title: "Week 12: Reflections on Presentations"

<h2> Other Groups </h2>

<p> It was pretty unfortunate that our group missed some groups' presentations on Last Tuesday. However, I was pretty surprised by the fact that they were three groups doing Oppia! I wasn't familar with Oppia before, but I was able to know more about this open project after hearing people's presentations. One surprising thing that I found was that a well-known open source project might not necessarily have an organized management team. Instead, since the open source project is too big, it is harder to interact with the core managers. <!--more--></p>

<p> I was also very impressed by the work of team CAGOV. It was definitely hard for undergraduates to contribute to a big public organization, but members from CAGOV were able to make a lot of significant changes. Additionally, I loved to see how different groups chose to tackle various tasks and contributed to open source project in multiple fields. </p>

<h2> Open Library </h2>

<p> Our group attended the community meeting on last Tuesday. During the meeting, Mek taught us how to run different testings. We were also able to introduce ourselves to all of the contributors from all around the world! </p>

<p> In terms of our work progress, Michelle and Crystal's PR got merged! I also submitted my PR and waited for approval. During our weekly meeting on this Saturday, we worked on our final presentation for this upcoming Thursday. </p>
