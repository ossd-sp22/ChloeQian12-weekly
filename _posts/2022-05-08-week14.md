<h2> Last Week of Class </h2>

<p> I was able to hear more open source projects during the last week of class. I think every project was very interesting, and the presentations showed that how much effort each individual had put in for this class.<!--more--></p>

<p> Among all the projects that were presented this week, I was very impressed of the work done by the two blender groups. They were both very honest and shared their struggles of reaching out to the community leaders. Hearing their presentations definitely made me realized that it was very important to be advocative in the open source community. Since an open source project is huge and made of members from all around the world, you have to stand up and express yourself so that people can hear your voice.</p>

<p> I was also very happy to hear that my work of translating files inspired other people to also do the same. Honestly, I didn't know that people would follow my task in their projects since it's not very technical but also time-consuming. However, I am very glad that the task of translating also worked out in other groups.</p>

<p> This course is my last CS elective at NYU. I don't regret taking this course at all since I do not only learn about the open source work, but most importantly, cooperate with fellows and actually become great friends with them. I will cherish this experience forever. </p>
