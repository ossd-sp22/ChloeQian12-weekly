<h2> My Experience with Group Project </h2>

<p> In the past two weeks, I worked with Michelle and Crystal on our group project. We had our first meeting on last Saturday. It went pretty well, and we actually acoomplished a few tasks. <!--more--></p>

<p> The first task was reaching out to the members of OpenLibrary. We filled out a google form individually to show what kinds of contributions we looked for and the time we expected to spend on the project. However, it is disappointing that we still haven't heard back from OpenLibrary until today. </p>

<p> We also joined gitter, a platform which OpenLibrary communicates. In gitter, I saw a member asking help for Chinese translation. I was very excited because that was something that I could contribute to. I immediately replied to the member and now am assigned to the issue. In the next week or so, I will focus on solving this issue. </p>

<p> Another thing that we accomplished in the meeting was to set up the environment. The process of setting up was very complicated. However, both of my teammates helped me a lot with that. Additionally, the step-by-step instructions of environment set-up was very clear on Github, which also helped me save a lot of time in terms of figuring out what to do. </p>

<p> In the upcoming weeks, I hope to achieve my first contribution. Also, I want to attend one of their team meetings to meet the memebers at OpenLibrary! </p>
